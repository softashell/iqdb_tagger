Overview
--------

Get result from iqdb.org from CLI using python3.

Feature::

 - Written for python3
 - iqdb and danbooru.iqdb parser
 - Hydrus integration


Usage
-----


Use as Hydrus as cli program
````````````````````````````

To parse folder of images (e.g. in this example :code:`image_folder:`) and write tags to text file, use following command:

.. code:: bash

    iqdb-tagger cli-run --resize --match-filter best-match --write-tags --input-mode folder image_folder


Use as Hydrus iqdb script server
````````````````````````````````
1. Run :code:`iqdb-tagger run` and note the server address.

  To run it on `127.0.0.1` on port `5006`, run the following command:

.. code:: bash

    `iqdb-tagger run -h 127.0.0.1 -p 5006`

2. Import one of the parsing scripts below to Hydrus parsing scripts.
3. Check the server address and edit it as needed.

IQDB parsing script

.. code:: json

    [32, "local iqdb", 2, ["http://127.0.0.1:5006", 1, 0, [55, 1, [[], "some hash bytes"]], "file", {"place": "0", "resize": "on"}, [[29, 1, ["link", [27, 5, [[["a", {"data-status": "best-match", "class": "img-match-detail"}, null]], 0, "href", [51, 1, [3, "", null, null, "example string"]], [55, 1, [[], "parsed information"]]]], [[30, 2, ["", 0, [27, 5, [[["li", {"class": "tag-creator"}, null]], 1, "", [51, 1, [3, "", null, null, "example string"]], [55, 1, [[], "parsed information"]]]], "creator"]], [30, 2, ["", 0, [27, 5, [[["li", {"class": "tag-series"}, null]], 1, "", [51, 1, [3, "", null, null, "example string"]], [55, 1, [[], "parsed information"]]]], "series"]], [30, 2, ["", 0, [27, 5, [[["li", {"class": "tag-character"}, null]], 1, "", [51, 1, [3, "", null, null, "example string"]], [55, 1, [[], "parsed information"]]]], "character"]], [30, 2, ["", 0, [27, 5, [[["li", {"class": "tag-general"}, null]], 1, "", [51, 1, [3, "", null, null, "example string"]], [55, 1, [[], "parsed information"]]]], ""]]]]]]]]

Every uploaded and match history can be seen on Front page (in this case http://127.0.0.1:5006).

Using IQDB-tagger with Hydrus API
`````````````````````````````````

Set up your hydrus to get the access key, which will be used for this feature.

Install the required hydrus package

.. code:: bash

   pip install https://gitlab.com/cryzed/hydrus-api/-/archive/master/hydrus-api-master.zip


After that you can run the command below. For example to run the command with image tagged as 'thread:cat' on hydrus

.. code:: bash

   # to get tags
   iqdb-tagger search-hydrus-and-send-tag --access_key 1234_your_access_key 'thread:cat'
   # to get matching urls
   iqdb-tagger search-hydrus-and-send-url --access_key 1234_your_access_key 'thread:cat'

Note: hydrus version 349 have default bandwidth of 100 mb data per month,
which may raise `ApiError` when the bandwidth reached.

to fix it, go to `services` menu -> `manage services` -> client api and raise your bandwidth limit

Setting Hydrus iqdb script server on NAS
````````````````````````````````````````

Here is example for Synology DS1817+ with DSM6.1.7 running on an Intel Atom C2538

0. Make sure SSH is turned on in your control panel
1. Install python 3 community package: https://synocommunity.com/package/python3
2. Install pip3

.. code:: bash

  install pip3 with:
  sudo -i
  wget https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py
  python3 get-pip.py

3. Install iqdb-tagger

.. code:: bash

  cd /volume1/@appstore/py3k/usr/local/bin
  ./pip install iqdb_tagger

3.1 Add `bin` folder to path (optional)

.. code:: bash

  export PATH=$PATH:/volume1/@appstore/py3k/usr/local/bin

That command line above can also be put on `~/.bashrc`, so NAS will run it everytime user login.

Installation
------------

Install it with from pypi

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install iqdb_tagger

Or install it manually

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/softashell/iqdb_tagger.git
    $ cd iqdb_tagger
    # run the command below
    $ python setup.py install
    # for windows user: to force it using python3 run following command
    $ python -3 setup.py install
    # or
    $ pip install .

If you are in windows and get SyntaxError, check your python version.
To install under python3 follow the instruction on this link https://stackoverflow.com/a/18059129/1766261

FAQ
---

libxml error in Windows
```````````````````````

If you are encounter this error on Windows

.. code::

    Could not find function xmlCheckVersion in library libxml2. Is libxml2 installed?

Please follow this guide to install lxml: `StackOverflow - how to install lxml on windows?`_

Contributing
------------

To test the program do the following:

.. code:: bash

  $ # install required package
  $ pip install -e ".[dev]"
  $ cd docs
  $ make test

To upload the new version, do the following:


1. register to pypi and test.pypi
2. upgrade setuptools. setuptools>=38.6.0 is required to produce a distribution with the new metadata
3. make a source distribution. command: python setup.py sdist. in this example it will produce dist/iqdb_tagger-0.3.2.tar.gz
4. install twine>=1.11.0.
5. upload first to test.pypi. command: twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/iqdb_tagger-0.3.2.tar.gz
6. if upload success but result is not as intended, change the version with postn-suffix format. fix the program and go to number 5.
7. if upload sucsess and result is as intended:

  1. check the program version. maybe rolled it back to original if possible
  2. upload it to pypi. command: twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/iqdb_tagger-0.3.2.tar.gz

this guideline is based on this guide https://dustingram.com/articles/2018/03/16/markdown-descriptions-on-pypi
